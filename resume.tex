% --- SUMMARY ---
\ressection{Professional Summary}

I'm an independent researcher with a B.S. in Chemical Engineering and five years of experience modeling casino promotional economics. I build analytical tools that quantify promotional value, model player decision-making, and analyze multi-platform optimization strategies. This work provides insight into how sophisticated players assess promotional structures and where design choices create unintended cost exposure. I'm currently analyzing high-purity electronic gases at Linde Electronics, applying rigorous statistical validation to high-stakes manufacturing processes. I'm also a FanDuel VIP customer with firsthand understanding of player engagement and reward transparency challenges.

\ressection{Analytical Projects}

\noindent\textbf{Casino Promotional Value Analyzer}\par\vspace{2pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Built analytical engine that calculates exact expected value of casino promotional offers by modeling hedged bet positioning across platforms.
    \item Developed iterative solver handling deposit bonuses and loss rebates, calculating optimal bet sizing that produces deterministic outcomes.
    \item \textbf{Key Insight:} Demonstrated that wagering requirements can be satisfied with zero actual gambling risk through structural understanding of game mechanics and cross-platform hedging.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{4pt}\noindent\textbf{Baccarat Shoe Time Analysis}\par\vspace{2pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Conducted statistical hypothesis testing to analyze whether betting window duration in live dealer baccarat correlates with outcome patterns or bonus bet success rates.
    \item Built data collection framework extracting timing data from live sessions, performed correlation analysis and significance testing across multiple variables.
    \item \textbf{Key Insight:} Failed to reject the null hypothesis, but the methodology demonstrated rigorous experimental design and hypothesis validation---more valuable than a spurious correlation would have been.
\end{itemize}

\vspace{4pt}\noindent\textbf{Risk-Adjusted Betting Model}\par\vspace{2pt}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developed sequential betting methodology that uses bonus value to reshape gambling risk profiles, establishing zero-downside floor (break-even worst case) while preserving exponential upside from win streaks.
    \item Built calculation engine that determines maximum ``safe'' bet sizes at each decision point where losses still result in break-even after completing wagering requirements through mini-hedging.
    \item \textbf{Key Insight:} Demonstrates that bonuses create optionality allowing sophisticated players to structure positions with significantly higher expected value than face-value bonus amounts, revealing unintended cost exposure for operators.
\end{itemize}
